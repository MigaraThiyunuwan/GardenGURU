Utilized MySQL as the database system, implementing a robust DbConnector class with PDO for efficient database interactions. Developed features including a shopping system, user-generated content (blog, advertisements), manager functionalities, and insightful reporting. Excited to share my project journey and showcase the impact of technology in solving real-world challenges.
